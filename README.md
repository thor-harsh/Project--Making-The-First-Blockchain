# Project--Making-The-First-Blockchain

<table>
  
**In this project We will build our First Block Chain and will use Flask to make a Flask Web Application where our Blockchain will run. We will also use Postman to visualize the Blockchain.** <br></br>

**We are gonna performing three doing in Blockchain using Postman**<br></br>

**a:** Visualize our Blockchain <br></br>
**b:** Mine the Block in the Blockchain <br></br>
**c:** Check the Validity of our Blockchain <br></br>

**Before jumping to the code lets understand Blockchain First**...<br></br>

**What is Blockchain**?<br></br>
A blockchain is a distributed database or ledger shared among a computer network's nodes. They are best known for their crucial role in cryptocurrency systems for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions, but they are not limited to cryptocurrency uses. Blockchains can be used to make data in any industry immutable‚Äîthe term used to describe the inability to be altered.<br></br>

Because there is no way to change a block, the only trust needed is at the point where a user or program enters data. This aspect reduces the need for trusted third parties, which are usually auditors or other humans that add costs and make mistakes.Since Bitcoin's introduction in 2009, blockchain uses have exploded via the creation of various cryptocurrencies, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and smart contracts.<br></br>

Blockchain is a type of shared database that differs from a typical database in the way it stores information; blockchains store data in blocks linked together via cryptography.<br></br>
Different types of information can be stored on a blockchain, but the most common use for transactions has been as a ledger.<br></br>
In Bitcoin‚Äôs case, blockchain is decentralized so that no single person or group has control‚Äîinstead, all users collectively retain control.<br></br>
Decentralized blockchains are immutable, which means that the data entered is irreversible. For Bitcoin, transactions are permanently recorded and viewable to anyone.<br></br>
